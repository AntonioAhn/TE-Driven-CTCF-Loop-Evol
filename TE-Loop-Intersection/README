# Pipeline for analysis of overlap between TE-derived CTCF sites and chromatin loop
# anchors in human GM12878 and K562 cells (RAD21 ChIA-pet data), and mouse CH12 cells
# (Rao et al. Hi-C data). Data are presented in Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 3.

# Initial data preparation and table creation/loading are described in
# ../data/hadoop/README and subfolders.

# First step intersects loop data with TE/CTCF ChIP-seq data using a hive query
# described in intersect-loop-te.q

# Data tables are then compiled with hdfs calls. Copy these to the local directory.
