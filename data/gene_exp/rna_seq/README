normCountsComplete.tab contains normalized gene expression values for human GM12878 and K562 cells, and mouse CH12 and MEL cells. These were prepared from the BAM alignment files from the RNA-seq datasets cited in the Source Data file. These were normalized using an aggressive method designed to correct for batch effects, described in:

Gilad Y., Mizrahi-Man O. A reanalysis of mouse ENCODE comparative gene expression data. F1000Res. 2015; 4:121–153.

The data were originally prepared for another study with the complete process described here:
