# Reciprocal-best liftover chains were prepared based on the human hg19 to mouse mm9 liftover chain from UCSC.
# All liftover chain were obtained from the UCSC download portal:
# http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/liftOver/hg19ToMm9.over.chain.gz


# The conversion to reciprocal-best chains is described here:
# http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/HowTo:_Syntenic_Net_or_Reciprocal_Best
# Conversion was achieved by calling the do_rbest.sh shell script for
# each pair of species.

# Human-mouse (and reverse)
do_rbest.sh hg19 mm9 chrom.sizes

# Mouse to dog, horse, and elephant
do_rbest.sh mm9 canFam2 chrom.sizes
do_rbest.sh mm9 equCab2 chrom.sizes
do_rbest.sh mm9 loxAfr3 chrom.sizes

# Human to dog, horse, and elephant
do_rbest.sh hg19 canFam2 chrom.sizes
do_rbest.sh hg19 equCab2 chrom.sizes
do_rbest.sh hg19 loxAfr2 chrom.sizes
