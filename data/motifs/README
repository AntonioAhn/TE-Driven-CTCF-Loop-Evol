# CTCF motif predictions with a loose threshold using a custom script. Prediction scores
# are simple log-odds scores, and all scores > 0 are retained in the prediction sets.
# Genomic sequences are from UCSC, builds hg19 (human) and mm9 (mouse). These can be
# obtained from the UCSC download portal. All chromosomes were concatenated into hg19.fa
# and mm9.fa.
