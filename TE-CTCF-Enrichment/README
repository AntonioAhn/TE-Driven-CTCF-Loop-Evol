# Analysis steps for binomial and permutation-based enrichment tests for CTCF binding
# in transposable element families.

####
# First step is performed on the hadoop cluster...

# Find the intersection between CTCF binding sites
# and TE insertions in each cell type using a hive query.
# Commands are in ctcf_te_overlaps.q.

# Combine the resulting data files...

# Remaining analysis steps are in R.
#
# shared.R has commands for reading in the data tables used
# by both binomial and permutation tests.
#
# binomial_tests.R has commands for performing the binomial enrichment tests.
#
# permutation_tests.R has commands for performing the permutation-based enrichment tests.
