# Permutation Enrichment Testing pipeline.

####
# Initial intersections between CTCF binding sites and TEs in human
# and mouse genomes was performed on the hadoop cluster using the
# hive query described in ctcf_te_overlaps.q. The resulting data were
# then extracted into a data file with the following command:
# hdfs dfs -cat ctcf_te_enrichment/* > ctcf_te_intersection.all.txt

####
# Remaining analysis steps are in R.
/usr/bin/env Rscript --vanilla do_permutation_tests.R
